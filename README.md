## Overview
This project is a dynamic blog website where users can browse articles, search for content, create an account, and write an article. Users can also perform CRUD opertaions on their uploaded articles under POST section , sort content by date, and subscribe to a newsletter.

## Features

- Pagination system to navigate through multiple pages.
- Search bar to find articles by title or content.
- Sorting options (Newest First, Oldest First).
- **Newsletter Subscription:** A field in the footer where users can subscribe to receive updates.


### 2. Article Page
- Displays the **full content** of a selected article dynamically.
- Shows three **related articles** as thumbnails for further reading.

### 3. Article Management
- Articles are manually written and stored in a **MySQL database**.
- Images are stored in the project folder, with their file paths saved in the database.
- Users with an account can create new articles using a **submission form**.

### 4. User Authentication System
- **Sign-up** (Registration) and **Login** (Authentication).
- Secure password handling with hashing.
- **account Page** where users can upload an article and perform CRUD operations on  their posts (uploaded articles will be displayed in their account under the section POST) and manage their content.
