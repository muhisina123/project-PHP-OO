## Technologies Used
- **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3 
- **Backend:** PHP (for user authentication, article management)
- **Database:** MySQL (stores user data, articles, and image paths)

## Database Structure
The database is named `bloggers` and contains two tables:

### 1. `blogs` Table
This table stores manually added articles.

| Column Name | Data Type | Description |
|------------|-----------|-------------|
| id         | INT (AUTO_INCREMENT) | Primary key |
| photo      | VARCHAR(255) | Path to article image |
| title      | VARCHAR(255) | Article title |
| description| TEXT | Article content |
| user_id    | INT    | user id  |


when new user creates an article , the id from the blogger table is added to the blog table for that particular article under user_id

### 2. `bloggers` Table
This table stores information about users who create accounts and post articles.

| Column Name | Data Type | Description |
|------------|-----------|-------------|
| id         | INT (AUTO_INCREMENT) | Primary key |
| username   | VARCHAR(255) | Blogger's username |
| email      | VARCHAR(255) | Blogger's email |
| password   | VARCHAR(255) | Hashed password |
